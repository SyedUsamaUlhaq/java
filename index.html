        Q1. What is JavaScript ? <br>
       <br> A. JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. <br>
      <br> Q2.  Write down difference between Declaration and Initialization a variable. <br>
      <br>  A. Declarations specify the type followed by the name, and optionally the initialization. Initialization sets the variable to a new instance. It must be to a type that is compatible with the declaration type. In the above code, the variable a is declared as a string and is initialized to "Hello World". <br>
   <br> Q3. In how many ways we can define a variable . <br>
 <br> A. Basically we can declare variables in three different ways by using var, let and const keyword. <br>
 <br> Q4. Is variable is case sensitive ? <br>
<br>A. Variable names are not case sensitive. That is, you can use a name as uppercase on one line and lowercase on the next; both refer to the same variable. Production Reporting initializes variables to null (text and date) or zero (numeric). Commands can grow to whatever length the memory of your computer can accommodate. <br>
<br> Q5. When we declare a variable can we start it with any number? <br>
<br>A. Rules to Declare a Variable
A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign. The first character must not be a digit
